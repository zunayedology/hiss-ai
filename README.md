# Snake Game AI

It's an AI-powered game that plays and trains itself. The more it plays, the more accurate it becomes.

You can download the `.py` files along with the font. Save them in a same directory/folder. If you're using PyCharm, just open the folder in it and install the highlighted packages. 

Else, you can manually create an environment in that directory using `conda` or `pipenv` and install the following dependencies -
1. `pygame`
2. `pytorch`
3. `numpy`
4. `matplotlib`
5. `seaborn`

Run the code and the game should automatically start and train itself.
